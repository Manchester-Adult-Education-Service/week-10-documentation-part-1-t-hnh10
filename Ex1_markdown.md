In previous exercises, you have been working with **Python files (.py)** and writing **code**.  

For this activity, you will work with **Markdown (.md)**, a lightweight language used for **documentation**, **project read-me files**, **instructions**, and **notes**.  

Markdown allows you to format text so it is clear and well-structured.

> **Tip:** Right-click this file and choose **"Open Preview"** to view the formatted output neatly.

## Getting Started

**You will be editing the `README.md` file in your Assessment 3 GitHub repository.**

### Instructions:
1. Open your Assessment 3 repository
2. Look for a file called `README.md`
3. If the file already exists and contains a **Codespaces button** like this:
   ```markdown
   [![Open in Codespaces](https://classroom.github.com/assets/launch-codespace-2972f46106e565e64193e422d61a12cf1da4916b45550586e14ef0a7c637dd04.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/open-in-codespaces)
   ```
   **Leave it at the top of the file** and add your content below it.
4. If the file doesn't exist, create a new file called `README.md`

## What is Markdown?

Markdown allows you to format text using simple symbols.  

For example:
- `#` makes a heading
- `**text**` makes text bold
- `*text*` makes text italic
- `-` makes bullet points

This format is commonly used for:
- GitHub README files
- Programming documentation
- Tutorials and walkthroughs
- Technical reports

# Exercise 1 — Markdown Documentation Practice

## Task 1: Create a Proper Project Heading

Add a **main title** and a **short introduction** explaining what the project is about.

### TODO:
- Add a heading using `#`
- Write 3–4 sentences describing your project (e.g. What it does / Who it is for)

**Example structure (not content):**

```markdown
# Project Name

Short paragraph explaining the project purpose.
```

```python
# -------------------------------------------
# SAVING YOUR WORK
# -------------------------------------------
# Use Git to:
# 1. Stage your changes
# 2. Commit with an appropriate message
# 3. Push to the repository
# -------------------------------------------
```

---

## Task 2: Add a Section for Features

Create a section that lists key features of your program.

### TODO:
- Add a heading using `## Features`
- Add at least **four bullet points** describing what your program can do

**Example structure (not content):**

```markdown
## Features
- feature 1
- feature 2
```

```python
# -------------------------------------------
# SAVING YOUR WORK
# -------------------------------------------
# Use Git to:
# 1. Stage your changes
# 2. Commit with an appropriate message
# 3. Push to the repository
# -------------------------------------------
```

---

## Task 3: Add a Section Called "How to Run the Program"

Write a clear step-by-step numbered list.

### TODO:
- Add a heading
- Give practical steps for running the program

**Example structure (not content):**

```markdown
## How to Run the Program
1. Step one
2. Step two
```

```python
# -------------------------------------------
# SAVING YOUR WORK
# -------------------------------------------
# Use Git to:
# 1. Stage your changes
# 2. Commit with an appropriate message
# 3. Push to the repository
# -------------------------------------------
```

---

# Extension Activities

## Extension 1: Add an Image or Screenshot

Add an image using the Markdown image format:

```markdown
![Alt text](image-url.png)
```

If you do not have an image, write a sentence describing where one could go.

---

## Extension 2: Add a Table

Create a table showing example data or features.

Example template (**not content**):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| A       | Something   |
| B       | Something   |

---

## Extension 3: Add a Code Block

Add a formatted code block using triple backticks.

Example template:

```python
print("Hello world")
```

```python
# -------------------------------------------
# SAVING YOUR WORK
# -------------------------------------------
# Use Git to:
# 1. Stage your changes
# 2. Commit with an appropriate message
# 3. Push to the repository
# -------------------------------------------
```

# Advanced Activity

## Create a Final Professional README Structure

Combine everything into a polished version that looks real.

### Include:
- Title
- Introduction
- Features
- How to Run
- Example output
- Credits or Author name

Try to make it look like a real GitHub README.

```python
# -------------------------------------------
# SAVING YOUR WORK
# -------------------------------------------
# Use Git to:
# 1. Stage your changes
# 2. Commit with an appropriate message
# 3. Push to the repository
# -------------------------------------------
```

## Submitting Your Work

When you are finished:
- Save your file
- Preview it to check layout and readability
- Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub

---

Good luck, aim for clarity and professional formatting!
